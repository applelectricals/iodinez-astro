        India has emerged as one of the world's largest exporters of Povidone Iodine (PVP-I), supplying major pharmaceutical markets in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. For international buyers, sourcing from India offers significant cost advantages without compromising on quality—if done correctly.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Source from India?</h3>
      <p>
        The Indian pharmaceutical chemical industry is highly mature, with numerous WHO-GMP and USFDA approved facilities. Specifically for Iodine derivatives, Indian manufacturers have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to indigenous and imported raw iodine sources</li>
        <li>Advanced manufacturing technology for high purity grades (USP/EP/IP)</li>
        <li>Cost-effective production processes</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1. Identifying the Right Manufacturer</h3>
      <p>
        The first challenge is filtering through traders to find actual manufacturers. While platforms like Indiamart or Alibaba list thousands of suppliers, only a handful are genuine manufacturers with the right certifications.
      </p>

        <p class="m-0 font-medium text-blue-200">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Always ask for the factory license and GMP certificate. Verification of these documents is a standard first step in our sourcing process at iodineZ.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>2. Quality Verification Steps</h3>
      <p>
        Never rely solely on a Certificate of Analysis (COA) sent by email. We recommend a three-step verification process:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pre-shipment Sample:</strong> Request a 100g sample from the specific batch intended for shipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Independent Testing:</strong> We send these samples to reliable third-party labs (like SGS or Intertek) in India for validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Factory Audit:</strong> For large orders (FCL), a physical visit to the factory is crucial to inspect storage conditions and cross-contamination controls.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. Negotiating Pricing and Terms</h3>
      <p>
        Price variability can be high. Manufacturers often reserve their best pricing for long-term partners or large volume aggregators. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Payment Terms:</strong> Most manufacturers operate on an Advance Payment or LC (Letter of Credit) basis for new international clients. Negotiating credit terms usually requires a history of trade or a local partner's guarantee.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Shipping and Logistics</h3>
      <p>
        Povidone Iodine is generally non-hazardous for transport, but accurate classification is essential to avoid customs delays.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Ensure 25kg/50kg fiber drums are UN-approved if required for your destination.</li>
        <li><strong>Lead Time:</strong> Typical lead time is 2-3 weeks for production + shipping time (e.g., 20-30 days to Europe/US).</li>
      </ul>
